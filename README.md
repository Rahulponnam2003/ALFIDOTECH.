# Alfido Tech Internship Project

This repository captures my participation in the **Alfido Tech Internship & Professional Certification Program**, where I completed real‑world, task‑based projects under expert mentorship in the Data Science domain.

## 🧠 Project Overview

### **Phase 1: Internship Onboarding & Learning Goals**

* Joined Alfido Tech’s **Data Science track** as part of their internship and certification program ([LinkedIn][1]).
* Gained exposure to industry tools and frameworks, and aligned tasks with real business needs.

### **Phase 2: Hands‑On Technical Deliverables**

* Conducted **data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA)** on sample datasets.
* Engineered meaningful features suitable for predictive modeling and analysis.
* Built models (e.g. classification or regression) and evaluated them through standard metrics.
* Developed visualizations and dashboards to communicate insights effectively.

### **Phase 3: Insights & Certification**

* Compiled findings into a structured report or presentation summarizing model outcomes and business insights.
* Completed the program with an **industry‑recognised certification** and mentor feedback ([Alfido Tech][2], [LinkedIn][1]).

## 🛠️ Technical Stack

* **Languages & Tools**: Python, Jupyter Notebook, Pandas, NumPy, scikit‑learn, Matplotlib/Seaborn (typical stack for data science internships)
* **Deliverables**:

  * Notebook(s) performing EDA and modeling
  * Scripts or modules for feature engineering
  * Visual dashboards or slides summarizing insights

## 📌 Why This Matters

* Demonstrates completion of an **AICTE‑approved, task‑based internship** under Alfido Tech, offering hands‑on project experiences and mentorship ([Alfido Tech][2]).
* Showcases your ability to apply data‑driven approaches—from preprocessing to evaluation and actionable insights.
